# Electricity Market Forecasting Challenge
Developed a machine learning model for electricity regulation predictions, working with probabilistic classification.

## Overview
This repository contains a solution for a data science competition, where the goal was to develop a predictive model using machine learning techniques. The project explores various optimizations, including hyperparameter tuning, feature engineering, and model selection.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this competition includes multiple features that are preprocessed and engineered to enhance model performance. Feature selection and transformation techniques are applied to improve predictive accuracy.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features and selecting the most relevant ones.
3. **Model Selection:** Evaluating different machine learning models.
4. **Hyperparameter Optimization:** Improving model performance using techniques like GridSearchCV.
5. **Evaluation:** Measuring model accuracy using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Model Improvements
The solution initially started with a **Random Forest Classifier** with default parameters. Over iterations, hyperparameters were optimized as follows:

## Results
The final model demonstrated an improvement in accuracy and generalization, achieving better performance than the baseline model.

## Authors
Developed as part of a data science competition submission by Alejandra Cuadros Rivas.
